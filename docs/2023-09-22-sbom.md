## SBOM - Software Bill of Materials

Software Bill Of Materials (SBOM) answers the fundamental security questions an organization has "Am I affected?" and "Where am I affected?". In a world of software with complex library dependency graphs knowing answers to these questions enable organizations to understand if they are vulnerable.

### What is SBOM ?

SBOM is a machine readable inventory of software components, dependencies, information about the components. VEX (Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange) is a related concept to SBOM. A VEX document is an attestation, a form of security advisory that indicates whether a product or products are affected by vulnerability.
