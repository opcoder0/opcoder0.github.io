## Starteam Ant Extension (Check-in With Task ID)

Apache Ant has StarTeam tasks for check-in, check-out, label etc. I’ve modified the StarTeam Ant task to check-in with a specified Task ID. This could easily be extended to a CR (Change Request) as well.

The code (ant-starteam-ext-src.jar) and JAR (ant-starteam-ext.jar) has been shared on my share here [https://app.box.com/folder/24145340](https://app.box.com/folder/24145340). Look for my Box.Net share on my blog’s home page.

Some of useful links for developing ANT tasks for StarTeam –

Look for the ANT API in your ANT_HOME/docs/manual/api folder.
