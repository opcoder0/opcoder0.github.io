## Shared Libraries in AIX and Global Shared Library Area

In one of the environments I was running our software on was AIX 5.x. I had to patch the software with a fix (i.e. replace one of the shared libraries). The copied shared library with the fix didn’t work. I later realized that the new library was not loaded because the old library was still sitting there in the global shared library area. I had to clean up the library (i.e. unload the unused shared libraries) using the tool slibclean. After that I was able to use my fix. See this link for more details –
