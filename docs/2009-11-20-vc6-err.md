## Visual Studio - Error Executing C:\Windows\System32\Cmd.exe

I recently encountered this kind of error while building some projects on Visual Studio (VC++ 6.0) â€“

Compiling Resources...

```
Error executing c:\windows\system32\cmd.exe
```

After this there is no more messages. This gives user no clue as what could be wrong. I figured out that the project has Resources (.rc file) which uses some files like icons, BMPs etc. And some of those files were missing. Restoring those files helped me get rid of the error.
