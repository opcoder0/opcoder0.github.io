## Building Visual Studio 2005 Project Via Apache Continuum

Configuring Visual Studio 2005 Builds with Apache Continuum gives the error “fatal error C1902: Program database manager mismatch; please check your installation”.

Visual Studio 2005 has a bug for builds that are scheduled using the AT command or scheduling tools. This has been fixed via patch provided at the [http://code.msdn.microsoft.com/KB920770/Release/ProjectReleases.aspx?ReleaseId=752](http://code.msdn.microsoft.com/KB920770/Release/ProjectReleases.aspx?ReleaseId=752) Microsoft KB920770 link. Apply this patch and try re-scheduling the build and it would work fine.
